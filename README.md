**SplitLight** is a 2D atmospheric puzzle-platformer where you awaken in a forgotten dreamspace with no memory — only a fragile lantern to guide your way. Every step forward uncovers haunting memories and twisted reflections of the self. But beware: the more you reveal, the more the darkness sees you.

## 💡 Concept

> “You do not remember who you are.  
> All you have is a flickering lantern.  
> The deeper you go, the more the light reveals… and the more it attracts.”

You are a lost soul traversing *The Below*, a shattered world representing broken memories, regrets, and forgotten truths. Each level reveals metaphors for internal struggles. Your only guide is the lantern — a tool of light, identity, and danger.
